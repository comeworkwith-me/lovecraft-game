# NFT BROWSER GAME

This is a Buildspace project.

# ABOUT

I coded and deployed an Ethereum smart contract with playable NFT characters and an interactive web app using 
Solidity and React amongst 200+ developers. As a Buildspace hackathon, there was a live "kick-off" stream showcasing an intro to the project scope.

# USE CASE

For my project, I used HBO's Lovecraft Country as a game theme. Users can mint NFTs as playable game characters from the show and attack the Shoggoths by connecting their Metamask wallet to the free Rinkeby testnet.
